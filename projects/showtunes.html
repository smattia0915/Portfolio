As well as the information of what it is theyâ€™re watching and keeping users up to date on any news on updates, outages and more. </p></div>

                            <div class="projP4"><p>To compete with companies like IMDB the first thing to do was research on what the main struggles are with that website. Many of those being inconsistency, disorganization, too many or not enough filters, and whole new pages opening in the browser. Keeping  those thoughts in mind, then begin the wireframe and design phase. Followed by the implementation with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p></div>
