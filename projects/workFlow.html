That’s when I reached glasses, the ones I created in Adobe Illustrator are almost identical to mine. With most of my projects, some details come and go throughout the design process. In this instance, I had debated the idea of a hand manipulating the glasses, ultimately discarding that, and instead, the winking eye came to be. When animating, I moved the foreground elements first and then adjusted the background accordingly. Only effects and stylistic elements were added after completing the entire animation process.</p></div>
                        <div class="videoP2"><p>With this assignment, I wanted to make sure I understood the difference between a motion graphic and other types of animation before I began planning. So, before beginning my ideas list, I instead started by reviewing the class lecture and doing my research for examples. Once I felt I had a good grasp on what a motion graphic encapsulates, then I began coming up with ideas. This process was quite easier than before, knowing I didn’t want any text, just a smooth-moving object fulfilling an action. This time, there was no background, but I focused on the object whose movement affected the rest first: the bow. Repositioning the bow to pull back and shoot, then focus immediately swapping to the arrow, as the arrow affects the hoop movements, the target, and the timing of the confetti. Again, only adding effects, styles, and shadows after the animation was complete.</p></div>
                        <div class="videoP3"><p>This final project I was a bit more excited about and had ideas lingering in advance after already doing the previous motion graphic workshop. Quickly getting to work on a sword and shield. I had quite a few difficulties with my shield, however. Initially, I had an emblem in the center to make it more interesting and add to the appeal of the animation, but no matter what I tried, it would not work with what I was trying to accomplish. Despite changing the emblem completely multiple times, fully recreating the shield graphic as a whole, and checking that I imported it correctly, it just was not meant to be. Instead, I worked with what I had, adding bevels and shadows to the sword to give it more depth. The swords were my first focus while animating, though I wanted their animation to align in both timing and placement. Finishing with the shield coming into place on top of them.</p></div>
